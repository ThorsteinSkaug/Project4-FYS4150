# Project4-FYS4150

This repository has four parts. One folder C++ files, containing all the necessary code for Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the Ising model and the makefile. One folder for all python files, containing the ```plot.py``` file with all the plot codes and some minor calculations. One folder containing all .txt files made from the C++ code. And finaly one folder containing all the plots.

## C++ code

The C++ source folder contains two files, one ```makefile``` and one file containing all necessary C++ code called ```project4_main.cpp```. To run the C++ code see the next subsection:

### Parallelization

One can run the C++ code both with and without parallelization. To run without parallelization insert ```make unpar``` in the terminal window, to run with parallelization insert ```run par```.

## Plotting
To plot the results from ```project4_main.cpp``` we need to run the ```plot.py``` file.
